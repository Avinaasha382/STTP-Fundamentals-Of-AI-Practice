A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers arranged in rows and columns, commonly used in fields like mathematics, physics, and computer science. Matrices play a significant role in solving systems of linear equations, transforming geometric data, and representing graphs in computer algorithms. Various operations can be performed on matrices, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and finding the determinant or inverse, making them powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis.
