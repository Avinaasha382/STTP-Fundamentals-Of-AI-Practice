A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, organized into rows and columns, and is widely used across disciplines like engineering, computer science, and economics. Matrices are essential for solving linear equations, performing geometric transformations, and modeling networks in graph theory. Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and computing the determinant or inverse are fundamental when working with matrices, allowing them to be applied in various complex calculations and data processing tasks.
